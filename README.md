# COGS18_22

Project forked from https://github.com/drgreen/COGS18_22

My pourpuse is to improve it, correct errors and add notes in order use it as a quick concise introductory lecture on "Python basics & Machine learning".

* I am progresively adding corrections or comment/uncomment sections with example to clearly see the code in action.
* I may add some To-Do examples to make it more interactive.
